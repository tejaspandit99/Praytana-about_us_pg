  <p>प्रyatna is an initiative under Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya (SVVV),
Indore which aims at providing quality education to the students of government schools through
interactive medium. प्रyatna is a Non Profitable Organization run and managed by the students
and faculties of SVVV who believe that Communication Skills and Computer Education are the
two important aspects of education which cannot be overlooked.
प्रyatna wishes to work with the teachers at government schools to gain the
valuable experience from them and boost the social serving agenda of the NPO. Also, this will
inculcate in our volunteers the feeling of giving back to the society.
We focus on teaching English and Computer Education through interactive
and creative mediums so as to infuse the knowledge of these vital subjects in students.
Additionally, we also try to give the students -artistic knowledge, general knowledge, and
awareness. Main aim of प्रyatna is to give children enough idea of possible career paths they
can pursue in the future, and to be able to live a bright future.</p>
